# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Classifier using PyTorch

A simple deep learning project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset** using a **fully connected neural network** built with **PyTorch**.

This project is designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of deep learning — including tensors, layers, activation functions, loss functions, and training loops — through a hands-on example.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Trains on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 test images)
- ⚙️ Built using PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` model for simplicity
- 🧠 Achieves around **97–98% test accuracy**
- 🖼️ Visualizes real handwritten digits and the model’s predictions
- 💡 Perfect as a **beginner deep learning project**
